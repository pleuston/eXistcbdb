    <c_notes>Chao(2) Qianzhi [10] The Chao(2) traced their ancestry to Chao Cuo [3019], the famous minister of the early Han emperors. Qianzhi's ancestors were Chanzhou [Qingfeng xian] people, but his father was a Jizhou, Juye xian person. The Chanzhou and Jizhou Chaos were branches (fang) of the same lineage (zu). Zhou Bida writes that the Shanzhou and Jizhou Chao(2) were eastern and western branches (fang) of the same lineage. With the move south, Qianzhi established residence in Xinzhou, Yanshan xian, where he died and his descendants maintained this family (jia) branch of the lineage. Duanren's [3022] son, Zhongcan's [3013] grandson. His mother, Ye(1) Shi[5379], is identified as the daughter of Ye(1) Ai in her funerary inscription, but her brothers Ye(1) Changling [4065] and Ye(1) Changyan [4066] are both sons of Ye(1) Shu [4073]. Since the generational names are the same, we can assume that Ai and Shu are the same person, particularly since Chao(2) Duanren is named as a son-in-law in Ye(1) Shu's funerary inscription. Ye(1) Shu's ancestors were Hangzhou, Qiantang residents who served in the administration of the Wuyue kings and are probably kin to Ye(1) Wensou [2057] and Ye(1) Xisou [2048]. Ye(1) Shi married Chao(2) Duanren at the age of 22. One of Chao(2) Duanren's grandsons-in-law, Li(2) Xiangru [3500], was also Chao(2) Buzhi's [13] son-in-law. Qianzhi was also Gongmai's [12] kin.
