    <c_notes>Zha Dao  His father, Yuanfang [3002], served in the administration of the Southern Tang ruler, Li Yu [3551], and was one of his ambassadors to Song in 969. XCB, 10.11a, 55.4a-4b, 56.6b; SS, 296.18b-20b. According to Jiangnan TZ, 119.8a, he was a Taizhou, Rugao county jinshi in ca. 988 and his nephew Gongzhi [13314], son of Tao [13312], is listed as a jinshi during the same nianhao (duangong) and is listed as a 989 Xiuning county jinshi in Huizhou FZ, 6.3b. Another probable kin, Gongchen (not included in dataset) is listed as a Taizhou jinshi in Jiangnan TZ, 119.8b in the Chunhua period and is not listed in the Huizhou TZ as a Xiuning jinshi. His elder cousin, Tao, is listed in Jiangnan TZ, 119.7b as a Southern Tang jinshi from Xiuning county and Dao is listed in Huizhou TZ, 6.3b as a Xiuning jinshi #11 in 988. I deduce from this that Tao moved to Taizhou, Rugao at the beginning of Song, thereby establishing the Taizhou branch of this lineage. CBD, 2, 1543-4.[kinship with Shu and Yingchen is not yet checked.與查塾、查應辰的親戚關係未考。Hartwell將查道籍貫定為泰州如臯，所据為《江南通志》卷一百十九《選舉志》。据《宋史》卷二九六，查道本傳，及《新安志》卷八端拱元年榜進士，當為休寧人。另從子查拱之當為淳化三年進士，恐Hartwell所据《江南通志》有誤。</c_notes>
