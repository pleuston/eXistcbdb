    <c_notes>Chai(1) Tianyin [7] Identified in XNYL as a Kaifeng resident, but listed in Zhejiang TZ, 124.14a as a Quzhou, Jiangshan resident. Since Chai(1) Chengwu [6] was  buried in Kaifeng and Tianyin has the same generational name as Chai(1) Wei's [22959] grandfather, Tiancui [22955] and another Jiangshan jinshi, Tianxi [22956], the only conclusion is that these Jiangshan Chai were kin with Chengwu, who had probably moved to the home of his wife in Quzhou and then to Kaifeng and descendants later moved back to Quzhou. I am making Youpeng [22954], Tianyin's uncle or father, the lineage great great grandnephew of Chengwu(who does not seem to have had any surviving male heirs). XNYL, 13.1a, 14.9b; Shandong TZ; Wang Zao, WJ, 8.8b.[Not yet checked. 未考。]</c_notes>
